## What is the variance gamma distribution?

### The usual approach to investing 

#### Harry Markowitz's "mean–variance" portfolio optimisation

- To maximise return on investment 
- Also to constrain risk at the same time
- With risk viewed synonymously with variability and measured by variance
or standard deviation

- The *return* is defined as $r_t = \ln(s_t / s_{t–1})$, where $s_t$ represents the price of a stock at time $t$.
- Markowitz's model assumes that log returns of stocks and index funds are independent and identically distributed Gaussian random variables. 
- However, the data are actually skewed, with higher kurtosis than
would be expected: heavier tails and a more peaked center than a normal distribution.

### 

- A few such distributions meet early mentioned criteria
  - The normal inverse Gaussian 
  - The generalised hyperbolic, 
  - \alert {The variance gamma (VG)}


- The VG, also known as the generalised Laplace or Bessel function
distribution:

\tiny

$$
f_X(x| \mu,\ \sigma,\ \theta,\ \nu) = 
\frac {2\exp(\theta(x - \mu)/\sigma^2)} {\sigma\sqrt{2\pi} \nu^{1/\nu}\Gamma(1/\nu)} 
\Bigg( \frac {|x - \mu|} {\sqrt{2\theta^2/\nu + \sigma^2}} \Bigg)^{1/\nu - 1/2}K_{1/\nu - 1/2}\Bigg(\frac {|x-c|\sqrt{2\sigma^2/\nu+\theta^2}} {\sigma^2} \Bigg)
$$

$\Gamma(.)$ is the gamma function                   
$K_\eta(.)$ is a modified Bessel function of the third kind, of order $\eta$                   
$\mu \in (-\infty,\ \infty)$ is the location parameter                  
$\sigma \in [0,\ \infty)$ is the scale/spread parameter                
$\theta \in (-\infty, \infty)$ is the asymmetry parameter                     
$\nu \in [0, \infty)$ is the shape parameter                           

## What does it look like?

- A Unimodal, with a single peak, and heavy tails
- Decreases algebraically rather than decreasing exponentially
- The VG distribution is quite flexible

### Moments

Cannot be completely described by the first two moments, mean and variance 
The shape parameter $\nu$ for kurtosis to the normal distribution with a kurtosis of 3
With an assumed small skewness ($\theta$)

The first four moments of the VG are:

1. mean: $E[X_t] = \mu + \theta$
2. variance: $Var[X_t] = \sigma^2$
3. skewness: $\gamma[X_t] = 3\theta\nu/\sigma$
4. kurtosis: $\kappa[X_t] = 3(1 + \nu)$

### Summary

Three common ways to simulate from the VG distribution are: 

1. As a time-changed Brownian motion with a gamma

2. The difference of two non-decreasing (Gamma) processes

3. Using a compound Poisson process, for an approximation

An R package, VarianceGamma (bit.ly/2NZZnJ2), includes the ability to estimate parameters 
from data and also simulate random variates.
